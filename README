HOW TO IMPORT LIBRARY

1. Import libVTiOSAPI.a

- Create a swift project from XCode
- Create a folder named 'lib' under your root project folder (this is optional, you could always put it elsewhere)
- Copy libVTiOSAPI.a to previously created 'lib' folder
- Open XCode and click on project structure
- Choose 'Build Phases'
- Under 'Link Binary With Libraries' click the '+' symbol and choose 'add other'
- Browse to previously create 'lib' folder and choose libVTiOSAPI.a, it should add libVTiOSAPI.a under your tree project

2. Create Bridging-Header file


- Copy 'include' folder from 'bin' folder to your root project folder
- Click on project structure
- Choose 'Build Settings'
- Search for 'Objective-C Bridging Header' under 'Swift Compiler - Code Generation'
- Double click on input on the right side, and put '$SOURCE_ROOT/include/VTiOSAPI-Bridging-Header.h' (make sure 'include' folder is inside your root project)
- Now you can use VTiOSApi in your project. If you need any examples, please refer to this sample.

All 'include' and 'lib' files can be found in 'bin' folder
